## Overview

SnapCore is a modern privacy-focused application that reimagines how content creators generate thumbnails from videos and images. At its core, SnapCore is built around the concept of local processing - ensuring all editing happens in your browser while keeping your content completely private and secure.

## The SnapCore Experience

SnapCore transforms thumbnail creation through local browser processing - ensuring your content never leaves your device. Users upload videos or images, capture perfect frames at precise moments, and leverage AI-powered background removal for clean compositions. Within the editor, users add text overlays with extensive styling options, apply professional filters, and see real-time previews of every change. The responsive design adapts seamlessly to any device, and high-resolution export options optimize thumbnails for different platforms.

## Why SnapCore?

SnapCore combines the best of video editing, AI processing, and privacy protection into one seamless experience. Whether you're a YouTuber creating thumbnails, a social media manager designing content, or a marketer building campaigns, SnapCore provides the tools and platform to make it happen.

Built with modern web technologies and designed for privacy, SnapCore offers a responsive, accessible, and beautiful experience across all devices.

## Privacy & Security

Your privacy is our top priority. All processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring your content never leaves your device. No data is sent to external servers, and no account registration is required. Your content remains completely private and secure throughout the entire creation process.
